# Netflix User Behaviour Analysis 

This project simulates the work of a data analyst at Netflix. It explores viewing behavior across genres, user types, devices, and countries to generate meaningful business insights.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis Performed
- Most-watched genres and titles
- Device usage breakdown (TV, mobile, etc.)
- Monthly viewing trends
- Comparison between Teen and Adult viewers

##  Sample Visualizations
- Bar chart of top genres
- Line chart of monthly viewing activity
- Pie chart of device distribution

##  Files
- `Netflix_User_Analysis.ipynb` — the main Jupyter notebook
- `netflix_user_data.csv` — dataset used (simulated)

##  Outcome
This analysis demonstrates real-world data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and interpretation skills — just like what’s needed in a data analyst job.
